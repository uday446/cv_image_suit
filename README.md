# cv_image_suit

## 💡 What is cv_image_suit:

A libray to train or experiment with different hyper parameter of a computer vision image classification problem like best model, optimizer, image size etc. Library is 
completely UI based. 

## 📝 Proposed Solution:

The solution proposed here is a computer vision based system which can be used to perform above mentioned use cases. In the above mentioned use case this system will ask the user to provide image for prediction, data for training in in proper folder structure accepted by keras. 


## 🛠 Tools used

Python programming language and frameworks such as Fastapi, Tensorflow 2.9.1 are used to build the whole system.

- For visualization of the plots, Tensorboard is used.
- Pypi Cloud Platform is used for deployment of the system as a package.
- Front end development is done using HTML/CSS
- Fastapi is used for api exposing
- GitHub is used as a version control system.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Image Classification using cv_image_suit:

## >>Installation / Setup of ImageSeeker
**First of all create a new conda environment and activate the environment:**
```bash
 conda create -n cv python==3.7.13 -y
```
```bash
 conda activate cv
```
**Great! After that install cv_image_suit from pypi using that command:**

```bash
 pip install cv-image-suit
```

If you done the installation then from your terminal just write **cv_image_suit** keyword it will automatically launch the UI on your local host.
